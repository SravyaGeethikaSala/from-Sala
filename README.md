### My favorite sport is Cricket

I like cricket because it's fun, exciting, and brings people together. My favorite player is **Virat Kohli**. I admire him for his **hard work and passion** for the game. He plays with great energy and always leads by example, which inspires me to enjoy cricket even more.
