# Sravya Geethika Sala


My favorite food is pizza. Itâ€™s simple, delicious, and can be customized in endless ways. The combination of a crispy crust, melted cheese, and flavorful toppings is irresistible. Whether it's a classic pepperoni or something more unique, pizza always hits the spot. Plus, it's perfect for sharing!
